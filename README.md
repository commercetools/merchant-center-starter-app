  <b>Merchant Center Starter Application.</b>
</p>

This repository contains an example application to run within a [Merchant Center](https://mc.commercetools.com) environment.

## Documentation

⏳ _coming soon_

> NOTE: until there is a proper documentation we recommend to look into the npm packages of `@commercetools-frontend` to check their READMEs and understand what you can use to build the application. In particular, we recommend looking at the `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit` package as well as `@commercetools-frontend/sdk`, `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`, `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors`. Look also at the example implementation to see how to combine the main elements.

### Getting started

Before you jump into developing the application, there are some important information to know beforehand:

- the project demonstrate how to set up and develop a Merchant Center Application
- a Merchant Center Application is a runnable React application, developed and built using the `mc-scripts` package provided by commercetools (_if you're familiar with `react-scripts`, it works very similarly to that_)
  - the `mc-scripts start` command will start a webpack development server
  - the `mc-scripts build` command will bundle the production assets into the `dist` folder
- the Merchant Center itself is composed by multiple applications running behind a proxy, each one of those serving a specific part of the overall Merchant Center (_e.g. dashboard, products, discounts_)
- building a "custom" Merchant Center Application, means building a new part of the overall Merchant Center, where eventually this "custom" app will be hosted by you and served from the proxy within the commercetools systems (_more on that will come soon_)
- in order to have the same main structure and "bootstrap" logic across the different applications, we built a component called `ApplicationShell` that MUST be rendered by each application within their entry points
  - the `ApplicationShell` contains among other things the `NavBar` component, where you see the "links" on the left-side menu
  - the `NavBar` component is shared across all the different applications, and needs to contain the main links of all the applications
  - the `NavBar` component by default only contains the links of the "official" applications (_e.g. dashboard, products, discounts_)
  - for custom applications, links are stored in the Merchant Center API and loaded asynchronously for a specific project. This means that you can't "manually" add links to the `NavBar` but instead you need to configure them with the settings (_more on that will come soon_)
- each Merchant Center Application usually defines ONE main route (_e.g. in this example the application defines a `/:projectKey/channels` route_)
  - routes should always contain the `/:projectKey`, as those "custom" application belong to a certain project
  - routes for "custom" applications should not conflict with the "official" routes (_e.g. `dashboard`, `products`, etc_), as "official" routes always take precedence
  - routes can and should have sub-routes, dependening on how many levels/views the application should have (_e.g. `/:projectKey/channels/:id`, `/:projectKey/channels/new`, etc_)

### Project structure

If you are trying to find yourself around the files and folders, here are some useful information where find what:

- `src` contains all the JS files to build the application
  - `index.js` is the application "entry point" and contains the basic imports to render the React app
  - `routes.js` contains the sub-routes and components rendered by the application (the main route is defined in the `<EntryPoint>` and is loaded asynchronously using code splitting)
- `dist` contains the production bundles
- `.env` contains the development ENV variables used by the webpack dev server (_more on that will come soon_)
- `.env.production` is an example of the ENV variables used by running the application in production mode (see below [Running in production](#running-in-production))
- `webpack.config.<env>.js` contains the setup for getting the webpack configurations for dev/prod (having those files is important as they are read by `mc-scripts`)
- `jest[...].js` contains configuration for the different runners (testing, linting, etc)

## Development

Checkout the source code of the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

A webpack server will start building the source codes and will open up a page in the browser. At this point you can start developing the app and webpack will reload the page whenever you make some changes.

> The `.env` file contains necessary ENV variables to run the application on localhost.

### API domains

The MC runs on 2 different data centers: one in `EU` and one in `US`. Depending on which one you would like to target your application, you need to adjust a couple of ENV variables in the `.env` file.

The MC API is available at the following domains:

- for `EU`: `https://mc-api.commercetools.com`
- for `US`: `https://mc-api.commercetools.co`

### Running in production

To run the application in production mode, you need to take a couple of steps:

1.  build the production bundles

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This will output a `dist` folder containing the JS bundles in the `dist/assets` subfolder. There is also a `index.html.template` which will be used to generate the final `index.html` with the bundle references.

2.  start the HTTP server (as Nodejs process)

The HTTP server comes shipped with the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server` package and provides a binary to start the server (`mc-http-server`).

To start the server, you need to provide the ENV variables either as a `.env` file or as inline ENV variables. You can look at the `.env.production` to get an idea.

In case you host the JS bundles on an external CDN, you need to point the CDN URL in the ENV variables. However, if you keep the assets within the server itself, you need to pass different arguments to the command:

```bash
# Using an external CDN. In the `.env` you should pass the URL pointing to the folder where
# the assets are stored.
$ CDN_URL=https://my.cdn.com/path/to/folder/ mc-http-server

# Not using an external CDN.
$ CDN_URL=/assets/ mc-http-server --use-local-assets
```

3.  start the HTTP server (as Docker image)

## Important notice

The application is not meant to be run as a standalone application, instead it should run behind a proxy within the MC environment (_more info on that will follow soon_).

Furthermore, the MC API used by the application has some **strict CORS rules** about the domains, which means that running the app as standalone from an random domain won't work.
